Future ideas:
  - multiple maws
  - wizards who project barries which cannot be passed until the wizard is consumed
  - warp points
  - wrapping maps
  - pickups which let you move through the void once (per pickup)
  - moving terrain? Probably not a good ideas
  - terrain which disappears on its own after some number of turns?
  

omnia erunt nihilum - all will be annihilated
omnia erunt nihilo - all will be nothing
omnia sunt nihilo - all this are nothing

All this arise from nothingness, and to nothingness all things return
