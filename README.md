# ...and to Nothingness Return

In the beginning, there was the Void.
In the beginning, there was the Not.
In the beginning, there was nothingness, and nothing more.

But as the Not slept, a horrid and repugnant essence arose:
Existence, a violent crime against the Void.

And the nothing could only answer, by disolving that Existence back into itself.

Start with nothing ... and to nothingness return

## About the Game

And to Nothingness Return is a small puzzle game about devouring the universe.
It was created in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 45 - Start with Nothing.

## Running the Game
To run the game from source, you'll need to have
[Ruby 2.3.x](http://ruby-lang.org) installed. You'll also need the gem
[bundler](http://bundler.io).

Once you have those, use `bundle install` to install the gem dependencies, and
`ruby ld45.rb` to run the game.

Windows and Mac users may prefer to download double-clickable versions of the 
game from [itch.io](https://philomory.itch.io/and-to-nothingness-return).

## Playing the Game
The objective of the game is to move the Maw of the Void through Existence,
devouring it and returning it to nothingness. However, the Maw must not leave
Existence until Existence has been completely devoured - if the Maw is entirely
surrounded by the Not, it too will return to nothingness, leaving some of
the world intact.
